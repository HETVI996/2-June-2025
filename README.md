<br>Answers 

<br>1) ML is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that enables a computer system to learn from data and improve its performance on a task without being explicitly programmed.
<br>
   a) Supervised Learning
      <br>  The algorithm is trained on labeled data
            #Common Algorithms:
              <br>  Linear Regression
               <br> Logistic Regression
               <br> Decision Trees
                 <br>Support Vector Machines (SVM)
<br>
  b) Unsupervised Learning
       <br>The algorithm is trained on unlabeled data.
      <br> # Common Algorithms: 
          <br>K-Means Clustering
          <br>Hierarchical Clustering
          <br>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
   <br>
   c) Semi-Supervised Learning
        <br>Uses a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data.

   <br> 
    d) Reinforcement Learning
         <br>An agent learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties.
         <br># Common Algorithms:
           <br>Q-Learning
          <br> Deep Q Networks (DQN)
         <br>  Policy Gradient Methods
<br>
<br>
  <br>
  2) | Feature                | Machine Learning (ML)            | Deep Learning (DL)                     |
<br>| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
<br>| Definition             | Algorithms that learn from data  | Subset of ML using neural networks     |
<br>| Data Requirement       | Works with smaller datasets      | Requires large amounts of data         |
<br>| Feature Engineering    | Manual feature extraction needed | Learns features automatically          |
<br>| Interpretability       | Often easier to interpret        | Often considered a "black box"         |
<br>| Performance (Big Data) | May underperform on complex data | Excels in complex data (images, audio) |
<br>| Examples               | Decision Trees, SVM, KNN         | CNNs, RNNs, Transformers               |

  3) ML Life Cycle
   
 <br> a) Problem Definition

  #Understand the business problem and convert it into a ML problem.

 # b) Data Collection

   #Gather relevant data from various sources.

# c)Data Preprocessing

   #Clean, normalize, and transform data.
