Answers 

1) ML is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that enables a computer system to learn from data and improve its performance on a task without being explicitly programmed.
<br>
   a) Supervised Learning
        The algorithm is trained on labeled data
            #Common Algorithms:
                Linear Regression
                Logistic Regression
                 Decision Trees
                 Support Vector Machines (SVM)
<br>
  b) Unsupervised Learning
       The algorithm is trained on unlabeled data.
       # Common Algorithms: 
          K-Means Clustering
          Hierarchical Clustering
          Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
   <br>
   c) Semi-Supervised Learning
        Uses a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data.

   <br> 
    d) Reinforcement Learning
         An agent learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties.
         # Common Algorithms:
           Q-Learning
           Deep Q Networks (DQN)
           Policy Gradient Methods

  2) | Feature                | Machine Learning (ML)            | Deep Learning (DL)                     |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Definition             | Algorithms that learn from data  | Subset of ML using neural networks     |
| Data Requirement       | Works with smaller datasets      | Requires large amounts of data         |
| Feature Engineering    | Manual feature extraction needed | Learns features automatically          |
| Interpretability       | Often easier to interpret        | Often considered a "black box"         |
| Performance (Big Data) | May underperform on complex data | Excels in complex data (images, audio) |
| Examples               | Decision Trees, SVM, KNN         | CNNs, RNNs, Transformers               |

  3) ML Life Cycle
   
  # a) Problem Definition

  #Understand the business problem and convert it into a ML problem.

 # b) Data Collection

   #Gather relevant data from various sources.

# c)Data Preprocessing

   #Clean, normalize, and transform data.
